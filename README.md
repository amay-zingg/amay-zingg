### Heya 👋

### My name is Anastasia & I'm invested in learning how to code!

I really love building projects and putting all the pieces together to make it complete! (We all know the work is never done though 🤪) (But that's okie, no small tweak is ever insignificant) 

###The repos I'm currently working on are: 

https://amay-zingg.github.io/carrey-ed_away/

The goal of this site was to create something like what was being asked in the Shopify Internship challenge for Web Development. I wanted to put my own twist on it to show that I'm a creative and fun person! (I ADORE Jim Carrey 😁)
◮ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & SASS

##Things I still need to work on; 
◮ I want to make a read more/read less button for the movie overviews
◭ Make the data from the firebase database update in a horizontal bar chart from chart.js as the rankings
◮ I'm trying to make a JQuery version - so I can understand how to make it work in Vanilla JS and in JQuery

https://amay-zingg.github.io/hana-site/

This is a portfolio website I'm working on for an author/illustrator friend of mine. This repo is just so she can see how it looks live while I make improvements.
◮ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & SASS

This is the portfolio piece I am most proud of! It's an art tour of Kensington Market in Toronto. 
◮ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, React & Firebase

##Things I still need to work on;
◮ Want the little info icon overlay screen to be shown on landing 
◭ Slideshow needs some attention. Photos optimized, add in information from main app for each photo as well (the location, artist and Instagram handle)

###Anastasia Fun Facts!
🐅 I LOVE tigers and tiger print
🎃 I LOVE Halloween (It's the creative spooky displays and costumes 😍)
🍁 I LOVE Autumn, October is my favourite month of the year! (If it's not obvious yet my favourite colour is orange, and that's what this time of year is all about!)
🤢 I don't like the taste of vinegar AT ALL and think balsamic is especially disgusting
