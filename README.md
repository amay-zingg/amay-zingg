# Heya üëã

## My name is Anastasia & I'm invested in learning how to code!

I really love building projects and putting all the pieces together to make it complete! (We all know the work is never done though ü§™) (But that's okie, no small tweak is ever insignificant)

#### Things I still need to work on;

This is a portfolio website I'm working on for an author/illustrator friend of mine. This repo is just so she can see how it looks live while I make improvements. I'm actually making an exact replica in Shopify at the same time to compare and understand the beast that is Shopify theme building!

‚ú∂ I want to make a read more/read less button for the movie overviews

‚ú∂ Make the data from the firebase database update in a horizontal bar chart from chart.js as the rankings

‚ú∂ I'm trying to make a JQuery version - so I can understand how to make it work in Vanilla JS and in JQuery
