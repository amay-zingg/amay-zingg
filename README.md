# Heya 👋

## My name is Anastasia & I'm invested in learning how to code!

I really love building projects and putting all the pieces together to make it complete! (We all know the work is never done though 🤪) (But that's okie, no small tweak is ever insignificant)

## The repos I'm currently working on are: 

## Hana Shafi Portfolio
✶ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & SASS

This is a portfolio website I'm working on for an author/illustrator friend of mine. This repo is just so she can see how it looks live while I make improvements. I'm actually making an exact replica in Shopify at the same time to compare and understand the beast that is Shopify theme building!

## Anastasia May Artist Site
✶ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, React

This is me trying to make a better version of my current artist website (https://anastasiamay.ca)

Site - https://amay-zingg.github.io/

Repo - https://github.com/amay-zingg/anastasia-art

## Carrey-ed Away
✶ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & SASS (JQuery in the works)

The goal of this site was to create something like what was being asked in the Shopify Internship challenge for Web Development. I wanted to put my own twist on it to show that I'm a creative and fun person! (I ADORE Jim Carrey 😁)

#### Things I still need to work on; 

✶ I want to make a read more/read less button for the movie overviews

✶ Make the data from the firebase database update in a horizontal bar chart from chart.js as the rankings

✶ I'm trying to make a JQuery version - so I can understand how to make it work in Vanilla JS and in JQuery

## Kensington Art Tour
✶ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, React & Firebase

This is the portfolio piece I am most proud of! It's an art tour of Kensington Market in Toronto.

#### Things I still need to work on;

✶ Want the little info icon overlay screen to be shown on landing 

✶ Slideshow needs some attention. Photos optimized, add in information from main app for each photo as well (the location, artist and Instagram handle) 

## Anastasia Fun Facts!

🐅 I LOVE tigers and tiger print

🎃 I LOVE Halloween (It's the spooky and gross creative displays & costumes 😍)

🍁 I LOVE Autumn, orange is my favourite colour & October is my favourite month of the year!

🤢 I don't like the taste of vinegar AT ALL and think balsamic is especially disgusting
