# Heya 👋

## My name is Anastasia & I'm invested in learning how to code!

I really love building projects and putting all the pieces together to make it complete! 
We all know the work is never done though 🤪, but that's okie, no small tweak is ever insignificant!

## Anastasia Fun Facts!
😁 My favourite palindrome is - No Mel Gibson is a casinos big lemon

🐅 I LOVE tigers and tiger print

🎃 I LOVE Halloween (It's the costumes & spooky and gross creative displays 😍)

🍁 I LOVE Autumn, orange + burgundy are my favourite colours & October is my favourite month of the year!

🤢 I don't like the taste of vinegar AT ALL and think balsamic is especially disgusting
